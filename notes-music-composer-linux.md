## Notes:
1. f you want to make your own electronic music, you'll want to find a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) you like. DAWs contain a number of features, but at their core they'll typically feature a sequencer to arrange notes, sequencer, a number of synthesizers to produce sounds, and the ability to interface with plugins (typically using VST) to apply effects to those sounds or entire tracks.
2.	TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks as various audio file formats. [http://timidity.sourceforge.net/]
