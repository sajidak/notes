### Other Spring Projects
- Spring Data
	- https://spring.io/projects/spring-data
	- provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
	- **Features**
	- Powerful repository and custom object-mapping abstractions
	- Dynamic query derivation from repository method names
	- Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
	- Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
	- Possibility to integrate custom repository code
	- Easy Spring integration via JavaConfig and custom XML namespaces
	- Advanced integration with Spring MVC controllers
	- Experimental support for cross-store persistence
- Spring Data MongoDB
	- https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb
	- provides integration with the MongoDB document database. Key functional areas of Spring Data MongoDB are a POJO centric model for interacting with a MongoDB DBCollection and easily writing a Repository style data access layer.
	- **Features**
	- Spring configuration support using Java based @Configuration classes or an XML namespace for a Mongo driver instance and replica sets.
	- MongoTemplate helper class that increases productivity performing common Mongo operations. Includes integrated object mapping between documents and POJOs.
	- Exception translation into Spring’s portable Data Access Exception hierarchy
	- Feature Rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring’s Conversion Service
	- Annotation based mapping metadata but extensible to support other metadata formats
	- Persistence and mapping lifecycle events
	- Low-level mapping using MongoReader/MongoWriter abstractions
	- Java based Query, Criteria, and Update DSLs
	- Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces including support for custom query methods.
	- QueryDSL integration to support type-safe queries. GeoSpatial integration
	- Map-Reduce integration
	- JMX administration and monitoring
	- CDI support for repositories
	- GridFS support
- Spring HATEOAS
	- https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas
	- **Features**
	- Model classes for link, resource representation models
	- Link builder API to create links pointing to Spring MVC controller methods
	- Support for hypermedia formats like HAL
- Spring Web Services
	- https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws
	- Spring Web Services aims to facilitate contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of flexible web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads. The product is based on Spring itself, which means you can use the Spring concepts such as dependency injection as an integral part of your Web service.
- Spring Flo
	- https://spring.io/projects/spring-flo
	- JavaScript library that offers a basic embeddable HTML5 visual builder for pipelines and simple graphs. This library is used as the basis of the stream builder in Spring Cloud Data Flow.
