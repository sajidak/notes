	- Channa dal
	- Coriander (Dhania) seeds
	- Cumin (Jeera) seeds
	- Mustard seeds
	- Fenugreek (Methi) seeds

2. Cool everything completely.
3. Mix all ingredients and grind to a fine powder using a mixer
4. Cool and store in air tight container

## Method
1. Boil tomatoes in water for 3-4 minutes (just enough water to cover the tomatoes) Switch off the flame and keep it closed for 5 minutes
2. After 5 minutes, remove the skin and mash the tomatoes well
3. Add rasam powder, few curry leaves, salt as needed and boil for about 5 minutes
4. Then add 1 1/2 cup of water and switch off the flame once froth starts forming at the top
5. Heat a tsp of ghee, add mustard seeds, and when it splutters add curry leaves and pour it over the rasam
6. _[Optional] Garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves_

## Tips
1. Always boil rasam on low flame
2. Switch off, once rasam becomes frothy at the top. Do not boil after that as it will not taste good
