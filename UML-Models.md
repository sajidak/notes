Use Case Diagram

Capture functional requirements with UML use case diagram. Each use case in a use case diagram represents a high level business goal that yields a measurable result of business values. (UML) Actors are connected with use cases to represent the roles that interact with the functions.

Sequence Diagram

Visualize the interactions between users, systems and sub-systems over time through message passing between objects or roles. If class diagram represents the skeleton of classes by showing their attributes and methods, UML sequence diagram complete the classes by representing the programming logic to be filled in methods' body.


Activity Diagram

Use UML activity diagram, the flowchart-based diagram to model the flow of control. Partition actions according to the type of participant involved.


Component Diagram

Components diagrams are used to model the structure of systems by showing how little parts of the system gear up in forming a bigger part, or forming the entire software systems.

Deployment Diagram

Models the physical deployment of software components with UML deployment diagram. In deployment diagram, hardware components (e.g. web server, mail server, application server) are presented as nodes, with the software components that run inside the hardware components presented as artifacts.


Package Diagram

Arrange and organize model for large-scale project with package diagrams. Package diagram is also good in visualizing structure and dependency between sub-systems or modules.


Object Diagram

View a snapshot of instances of classifiers in UML class diagrams. Similar to class diagrams, object diagrams show the static design of a system from a prototypical perspective.


Interaction Overview Diagram

View the sequence of interactions with UML interaction overview diagram. Interaction overview diagram helps represent complex scenario that involve multiple interactions presented as multiple UML sequence diagrams.

SysML Requirement Diagram

Requirement is what your clients want and what your team have to fulfill. It is so important that needs to be managed carefully. The SysML requirement diagram provides a visual approach in representing and managing system requirements. In a requirement diagram, requirements are shown as blocks, with connectors in between, illustrating the derivation, dependency and grouping of requirements.

Block Definition Diagram

Visualize your system hierarchy. Define the system/component classifications in blocks to get a better picture of interconnections between these system components.
