### distroshare-ubuntu-imager
Last update 10 Sep 2015
- Creates an installable live CD from an installed Ubuntu or derivative distribution
- by distroshare.com
- Distroshare Ubuntu Imager creates an installable Live ISO from an installed Ubuntu or derivative distribution
- bash script, similar to Remastersys and its forks
- Based on this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MakeALiveCD/DVD/BootableFlashFromHarddiskInstall.

  `cd ~/distroshare-ubuntu-imager-1.0 ./distroshare-ubuntu-imager.sh`

### Linux Respin
http://www.linuxrespin.org/
https://github.com/ch1x0r/LinuxRespin
Last Update: 2017-09-22
- Create a custom distro based on Debian
- Linux Respin can make a live version of your OS, or it can make a backup for a fresh install
- This is NOT for Ubuntu, Debian only

### Relinux
https://launchpad.net/relinux
http://mijyn.github.io/relinux/
Last Update 2012-11-09
- Make own Linux distro easily
- Relinux <= 0.4 currently only works on ubuntu. Version 0.5 will add support for other distros
- You can customize the system as much as you would like, except for these limitations (most of which will be removed in a future release):
	- It only supports GRUB2, so no BURG or GRUB-Legacy
	- It must have an X11 display, since Ubiquity (the installer) requires X11 to run
	- You cannot use another installer than Ubiquity
	- The compressed filesystem size must be below 4GB (no workaround). It will tell you if itâ€™s over 4GB (compressed), but I recommend that you keep your system size below 6GB (uncompressed).
	- It will install metacity, but in 0.3, this is removed.


## Notes:
- Ubuntu Mini Remix
- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/
	- Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.
