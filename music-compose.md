# Music Composer notes

## orDrumbox
> https://www.ordrumbox.com/features.php

- Each track is composed of notes, one or more notes by beat (allowing chords).
- On each note, you can independently control pitch (in semitones) and volume.
- On each track you can use either an automatic fill engine or a random engine.
- You can import your own sound files and use them as instruments with the orDrumbox.
- Online Drum Machine

### Working Notes
- 6.4. Pattern Editor Note Properties


- Instruments â†’ "Save library"

- ADSR Envelope Generator
	- An Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release envelope generator.
	- After you trigger a note, Hydrogen will
		- attack the note by increasing its volume from 0 to the full velocity of the note.
		- After reaching full velocity, it will decay the note by lowering the volume until it reaches the sustain level.
		- When the note is released, Hydrogen reduces the volume from the sustain level back down to 0.
	- Velocity
		- How hard you hit a note.
	- 9.3.1. Envelope Parameters
		- When the instrument is triggered, its volume is run through an ADSR Envelope.
		- The parameters operate as follows:
		- **Attack**
			- the amount of time that the volume of the sample goes from 0 to the full velocity of the note.
			- If the value is 0, the sample will play immediately at full velocity.
			- If the value is 1.0, the sample volume will use the maximum time available for the attack parameter. [1]
		- **Decay**
			- the amount of time for the volume of the sample to go from full velocity down to the sustain volume.
			- If the value is 0, the sample will immediately skip from the attack volume to the sustain volume.
			- If the value is 1.0, the sample volume will use the maximum time available for the decay parameter.[1]
		- **Sustain**
			- the volume to play the note after the decay phase is over, and until the note is released.
			- If set to 0, the note will be silent.
			- If set to 1.0, the note will play at full velocity.
		- **Release**
			- the time to fade out the note from the sustain volume back down to 0 (silent).
			- If set to 0, the note will fade out in the minimum amount of time (about 5 ms).
			- If set to 1, it will fade out for the maximum time available.[1]
		- If the sample is shorter than the times that you specify, the sample will end, regardless of which phase of the ADSR it is in.
		- If the note is sustained, it does not draw out the note while you are holding it. It only holds the gain (volume) parameter during that time.


	- Attack
		- The amount of time to go from 0 to full velocity.
	- Decay
		- The amount of time to go from full velocity to the sustain volume.
	- Sustain
		- The level (how loud) to hold the note between the sustain and the release.
		- It is a percentage of the velocity.
		- It does not depend on time.
	- Release
		- The amount of time to go from the sustain volume back down to 0.

- "Song" mode and "Pattern" mode
