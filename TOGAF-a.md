		- **Guide to Business Models**
		- basis for Enterprise Architects to understand and utilize business models
		- describe the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value

	- `BoK/g176-Business_Scenarios.pdf`
		- **Business Scenarios**
		- method is a technique to validate, elaborate, and/or change the premise behind an architecture effort
		- by understanding and documenting the key elements of a Business Scenario in successive iterations where:
			- Each iteration requires planning, data gathering, analysis, documentation, and review
			- Each iteration should improve one or more of the key elements
			- Iterations are repeated until your understanding is fit-for-purpose for deciding to move forward
		- Not examining all elements of a Business Scenario carries a risk of producing an incomplete solution, but care must be taken not to iterate unnecessarily.

	- `BoK/g178-Value_Streams.pdf`
		- **Value Streams**
		- The Business or Enterprise Architect should be able to model, measure, and analyze the various ways that the enterprise achieves value for a given stakeholder.
		- This includes the ability to decompose the creation, capture, and delivery of value into discrete stages of value- producing activities, each of which is enabled by the effective application of business capabilities
		- see the TOGAF ® Series Guide to Business Capabilities
		- This Guide provides an approach and examples for modeling business value.

	- `BoK/g189-Business_Capabilities.pdf`
		- **Business Capabilities**
		- Business capabilities provide an abstraction of the business reality in a way that helps to simplify conversations between interested stakeholders.
		- Defining a business capability’s supporting components (roles, processes, information, and tools) provides a business context for those supporting components.
		- Creating a business capability model for the enterprise promotes more of a common understanding of the business.
		- Defining business capabilities and a capability model is a means to an end.

	- `BoK/g190-Information_Mapping.pdf`
		- **Information Mapping**
		- Information Mapping provides the architect with a means to articulate, characterize, and visually represent the information that is critical to the business,
		- and to shape its representation in ways that enable a more detailed analysis of how the business operates today and/or how it should operate at some future point in time.

## Role and Skills of the Enterprise Architect (p472)

### Job description for an Enterprise Architect:
- The architect has a responsibility for ensuring the completeness (fitness-for-purpose) of the architecture, 
	- in terms of adequately addressing all the pertinent concerns of its stakeholders; and the integrity of the architecture, 
	- in terms of connecting all the various views to each other, 
	- satisfactorily reconciling the conflicting concerns of different stakeholders, 
	- and showing the trade-offs made in so doing (as between security and performance, for example). 
- The choice of which particular architecture views to develop is one of the key decisions that the Enterprise Architect has to make. 
- The choice has to be constrained by considerations of practicality, and by the principle of fitness-for-purpose 
- i.e., the architecture should be developed only to the point at which it is fit-for-purpose, and not reiterated ad infinitum as an academic exercise

- It is the responsibility of the architect to know and concentrate on the critical few details and interfaces that really matter, and not to become overloaded with the rest.

- the role of the architect can be summarized as to:
	- Understand and interpret requirements
	- Create a useful model
	- Validate, refine, and expand the model
	- Manage the architecture


***
The **Solution Architect** has the responsibility for 
- architectural design and documentation at a system or subsystem level, such as management or security 
- A Solution Architect may shield the Enterprise/Segment Architect from the unnecessary details of the systems, products, and/or technologies. 
- The focus of the Solution Architect is on system technology solutions; 
- for example, a component of a solution such as enterprise data warehousing.
